## 👀 About the problem

To calculate the income tax that an individual must pay, a country applies the following rules:

1) Tax on salary: individuals pay tax on their salary according to the following table:

| Annual Salary | Tax |
| --- | --- |
| Up to 30,000 per year | Exempt |
| 30,000 up to 50,000 exclusive | 10% |
| 50,000 or above | 20% |


2) If the individual obtained income from providing services, the tax charged is 15%.
3) If the individual obtained capital gains (real estate, stocks, etc.), the tax charged is 20%.
4) The individual can deduct up to 30% of their gross due tax with medical or educational expenses. However, if their medical and educational expenses are below this 30%, only the medical and educational expenses can be deducted.

Create a program to read how much income the individual obtained annually from salary, providing services, and capital gains. Also, read how much the individual spent on medical and educational expenses during the year. Your program should then generate an income tax report for this individual as per the examples.
