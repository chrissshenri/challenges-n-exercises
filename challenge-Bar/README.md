## 👀 About the problem

In a bar, the entrance fee is 10 reais for men and 8 reais for women. Each beer costs 5 reais, each soda costs 3 reais, and each skewer costs 7 reais. Additionally, the bar charges an artistic cover fee of 4 reais, but if the consumption amount exceeds 30 reais, the cover fee is not charged. Create a program to read the following data of a bar customer: gender (F or M), quantity of beers, sodas, and skewers consumed. The program should then display a report with the total bill to be paid by the customer.
