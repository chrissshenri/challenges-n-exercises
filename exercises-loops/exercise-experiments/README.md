## 👀 About the problem

Maria has just started her undergraduate course in medical school and needs your help to organize experiments in a lab for which she's responsible. At the end of the year, she wants to know how many guinea pigs were used in the lab and the percentage of each type of guinea pig used. This lab specifically uses three types of guinea pigs: frogs, rats, and rabbits. To gather this information, she knows the number of experiments conducted, the type of guinea pig used, and the quantity used in each experiment. Create a program that reads an integer value N, indicating the number of test cases to follow. Each test case contains an integer representing the number of guinea pigs used and a letter ('C', 'R', or 'S') indicating the type of guinea pig (R: Rat, S: Frog, C: Rabbit). Present the total number of guinea pigs used, the total of each type used, and the percentage of each type relative to the total number of guinea pigs used, with two decimal places.
