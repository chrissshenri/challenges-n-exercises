## 👀 About the problem

A fuel station wants to determine which of its products is preferred by its customers. Write an algorithm to read the type of fuel refueled (encoded as follows: 1. Alcohol 2. Gasoline 3. Diesel 4. End). If the user inputs an invalid code (outside the range of 1 to 4), a new code should be requested (until a valid one is provided). The program will be terminated when the entered code is number 4, and it should then display the message "THANK YOU" along with the quantities of each fuel.
