## 👀 About the problem

Write a program to read the coordinates (X,Y) of an indefinite number of points in the Cartesian coordinate system. For each point, write the quadrant to which it belongs (Q1, Q2, Q3, or Q4). The algorithm will end when at least one of the two coordinates is ZERO (in this situation, no message should be written).
