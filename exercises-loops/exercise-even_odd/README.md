## 👀 About the problem

Read an integer value N. This value will be the quantity of integer numbers that will be read next. For each value read, display a message indicating whether the value is EVEN or ODD, and also whether it's POSITIVE or NEGATIVE. In the case the value is equal to zero (0), your program should print only NULL.
