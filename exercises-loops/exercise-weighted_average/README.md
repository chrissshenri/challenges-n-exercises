## 👀 About the problem

Read an integer value N, which represents the number of test cases to follow. Each test case consists of 3 real values, for which you must calculate and show the weighted average. The first value has a weight of 2, the second value has a weight of 3, and the third value has a weight of 5. Remember that the weighted average is the sum of all values multiplied by their respective weights, divided by the sum of the weights.
