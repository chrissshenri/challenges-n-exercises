## 👀 About the problem

The program should read an integer value X indefinitely. (The program will stop when the value of X becomes equal to 0). For each X read, print the sum of the 5 consecutive even numbers starting from X, including X itself if it is even. If the input value is 4, for example, the output should be 40, which is the result of the operation: 4+6+8+10+12, while if the input value is 11, for example, the output should be 80, which is the sum of 12+14+16+18+20.
