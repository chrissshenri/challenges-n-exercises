## 👀 About the problem


Create a program to read a quantity N, then read the data of N individuals who participated in a contest with two stages of tests. For each person, the data to be read are: name, score of stage 1, and score of stage 2. You should store the data of the individuals in arrays.

The score for each stage of the contest can vary from 0 to 100 (no need to verify). An individual passes the contest if they achieve an average score of 70 points (average of the two stages).

After reading the data of the individuals, your program should display:

- Table of individuals along with their averages
- Names of the individuals who passed
- Pass rate
- Name of the individual with the highest average (assume no ties)
- Average score only of the individuals who passed

If there are no successful candidates, instead of displaying the average, show the message "No successful candidates."
