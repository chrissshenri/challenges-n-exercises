## 👀 About the problem


Create a program to read a quantity N (assume N > 0), then read the data of N athletes (name, gender, height, weight). Then, display a report containing:


- Average weight of the athletes

- Name of the tallest athlete

- Percentage of men

- Average height of women

If no women are entered, the average height cannot be calculated (since division by zero is not possible). In this case, simply display the message "No women are registered."

Perform data validation for height and weight, not allowing non-positive values for these data. Also, validate the gender input, only allowing values of "F" or "M".

Hint: To validate the gender, the logic is: keep asking the user to input again while the entered value is different from "F" AND different from "M".
