## 👀 About the problem

Create a program to read the value 'r' of the radius of a circle, and then display the value of the circle's area with three decimal places. The formula for the circle's area is: area = π * r^2. You can use the value of π provided by the library of your programming language, or alternatively, you can use the value 3.14159 directly.
