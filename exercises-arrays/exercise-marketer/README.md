## 👀 About the problem


A merchant wants to calculate the profit from the goods they trade. To do this, they have arranged for a list of N items to be typed out, each containing the name, purchase price, and selling price of the goods. Create a program that reads this data and determines and writes how many items yielded:

- profit < 10%
- 10% ≤ profit ≤ 20%
- profit > 20%

Also, determine and write the total purchase and selling value of all items, as well as the total profit.
